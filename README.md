# canvas-game-test

This project is intended to be a learning exercise exploring the HTML "<canvas>" element via the creation of a game using vanilla javascript.

Done:

- Created a new repo.
- created 3 boilerplate documents, all linked together:
    - index.html
    - style.css
    - game.js
- Add a basic canvas element and the coinciding styling to fill the screen at a 16x9 aspect ratio with no overflow.

Current tasks:

- Gather together a set of basic assets to use for the game.

<!-- Future To Do:

- Task
    - Sub Task -->
